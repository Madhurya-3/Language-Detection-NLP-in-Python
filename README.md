# Language_Detection(NLP)in_Python
Using a sample dataset of 17 different languages for training, built machine learning models to detect languages.
Used NLP techniques for text cleaning and lemmatization.
Used Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest Ensemble algorithms for building multiclass classification models.
Naive Bayes gave effective results with accuracy - 94.8%
